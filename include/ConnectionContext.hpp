/*
 * \class ConnectionContext
 * \brief The class ConnectionContext represents the connection of a client to RSD and through RSD to one or
 * multiple plugins. The connection between client and RSD is a TCP connection and is managed through a internal
 * instance of ComPoint. The connection(s) from RSD to one or multiple plugins is managed through a list of
 * ComPoints. ConnectionContext got three important main tasks.
 * -# Creating a new Context for a new incoming Connection
 *   - Check max. number of valid contexts.
 *   - Create a new ConnectionsContext with a new ComPoint for TCP.
 * -# Handle a incoming Message
 *   - Check destination namespace.
 *   - Create new ComPoint for IPC if needed.
 *   - Use existing ComPoints if possible.
 *   - Return response (json rpc result or error).
 * -# Manage the TCP/IPC connections of a client.
 *   - Add new ComPoints to the intern list.
 *   - Find existing ComPoints
 *   - close and delete ComPoints which are not needed anymore.
